# Chain modules in the order you want them
#
# Each module should specify input and output features.
# The term "feature" here is interchangeable with "metric" in cloudbrain.
# "feature" refers specifically to a tag which identifies the appropriate queue in rabbitmq to subscribe to.
# First module will always take metric "eeg" as input
#
#

  input_feature: "eeg"
  output_feature: "window"
